# __Country Trivia__

This is a trivia game for guessing country capitals and vice versa.

## Known Issues:

- A correct answer is an answer identical to the database, i.e spaces,  capitalizations etc.
- Saint must be entered instead of St. for some countries/capitals.
- Only Pretoria is accepted as the South Africa capital.
- Kingston is the capital of Jamaica & Norfolk Island.
- United Kingdom is the only accepted country for London.
